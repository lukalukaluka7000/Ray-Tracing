# Ray-Tracing
Simple ray tracing implementation with simple scene - intersecting rays with couple of spheres and planes.

Code is very messy but I just wanted to see Ray Tracing algo in action.

Every object in scene has it's own properties that can be messed around with.

Todo: read properties of objects from file, make code more readable, stop using glVertex static calls, send all you can to gpu, use engine which will first be extracted from FractalGeometry repository
