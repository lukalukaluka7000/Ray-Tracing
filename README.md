# Ray-Tracing
Simple ray tracing implementation with simple scene - intersecting rays with couple of spheres and planes.

Code is very messy but I just wanted to see Ray Tracing algo in action.

Every object in scene has it's own properties that can be messed around with.

Todo: read properties of objects from file, make code more readable :)
